# BIMCV-COVID-19
Valencia Region Image Bank (BIMCV) that combines data from the PadChest dataset with future datasets based on COVID-19 pathology to provide the open scientific community with data of clinical-scientific value that helps early detection of COVID-19

### This is (going to be) a pytorch implementation of the predictions


I put it in a separate directory, so I don't mess up your Repository, until I find something that works

First I will spend some time understanding the dataset.

Then I will try some pytorch implementations. If it doesn't work I will give it a go to Keras+TF.

I will work 30 minutes or so everyday, although I'll try to work a bit more if I get some free time.
